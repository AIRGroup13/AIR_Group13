Keep it up!"", 'Your video is definitely essential ! Enjoyed it. Thanks 🙏', ""Ok so I live in a cabin far up in the northern panhandle part of Idaho near the Canadian border. I used to live near Seattle which was much busier, noisier, and felt a little tense. My cabin overlooks a pond with a large mountain behind it. Deer, coyotes, and bear, walk through the meadow that is my backyard. I can't see any other houses and our forest provides the wood we need to stay warm in the winter. We live off-grid and until a few weeks ago did not even have internet or cell service. Because of safety issues we finally decided to get satellite internet so that we could contact the outside world if there is an emergency. Why do I describe all this? Because it is wonderful to live remotely amongst the wild animals, the forests, meadows, and rugged mountains. The truth is however, if you really have the chance to go for the dream of living in a remote cabin as we do, your priorities will change. You will be busy about other things! Wonderful in many ways but you will still be busy. Every minute will be full of something. Your environment will change how you see yourself and what you do with your time. So I would suggest first choose your environment (where you really want to live if you can) and then your environment will change you! \n\nLast Spring when there was a late snow, many of my rancher neighbors ewes started abandoning their newborn baby lambs because they didn't think they could keep them alive. My neighbor and I started rescuing these abandoned, dying lambs and bringing them into my kitchen and placing them next to our kitchen wood stove which is the warmest spot in the house! Eventually we had 8 baby lambs in my kitchen that we were feeding with bottles around the clock every four hours. They were so adorable and even though I was exhausted by this constant demand of bottle-feeding 8 babies they grabbed my heart and ran away with it. After these cuties were about 2 months old and still adding a distinctive smell to my small kitchen (and jumping on my table, running around in circles, and skidding across my floor), we decided to sell these babies. After all was I really going to start raising sheep? I didn't think I could do this on my own. These babies were no longer needing constant bottle feedings and they were finally eating hay. So we advertised these baby lambs and waited to see if anyone would buy them. Their own mothers were not willing to accept them as offspring so that was out-of-the-question. \n\nThe retired couple that came to look at the lambs were dressed nicely and had recently arrived back from an extended vacation. I hoped that they weren't too offended by the smell that faintly wafted throughout the kitchen. I apologized for the mess as I noticed that there were a few pieces of straw on the wood floor that my babies had nibbled on and dropped. These visitors seemed unconcerned. After asking about how much work the baby lambs would require they left without them. I reflected. Yes I could be back in the city in my busy hectic life, but the busyness would be different than what I was now experiencing. Living in my cabin has added such meaning to my life that I wouldn't change a thing. Every experience feels important and meaningful somehow. First I chose the cabin thinking it would give me a simpler life. It wasn't simpler. But the busyness and stress that my day-to-day life has now I wouldn't change for the world."", ""Just what I needed. You hit the nail on the head with essentialism. Didn't know that that is a thing. But this is what I've been searching for. Thank you for putting my feelings into words."", 'Living in a bustling city like Seoul, it can be really hard to find those quiet moments because even if you become more mindful, there are still lights, ads, and people creating content ALL around! Try to find a peaceful moment at river, but everyone is just posing and taking pictures. You start to feel weird and out of place for just enjoying something with your eyes. And, in my case... I get quite annoyed in my quest for a peaceful moment. \nI think with the explosion of social media apps, we\'ve become so backwards. Nature is no longer a thing to appreciate, but instead a thing to enhance our own appreciation. I think I heard it from the minimalists, ""we have all of these people taking all of these photos to places they never even experienced."" \nTake the picture so you can remember the moment and the beauty of the scene, but also remember to be in the moment. Pictures of beautiful places also help later when you maybe don\'t have time to go out. you can look through your camera roll and revisit the things you found beautiful and relaxing that day.\nI\'m not sure if any of that makes sense, but I hope you can understand my meaning. <3', 'Terimakasih banyak ya sahabatku ,shering vidio nya 👍🙏', ""Just came to this video for the second time because the first time I heard you I just didn't want to forget to make the notes ✨🧡 all of it it's just such a valuable insight into a better lifestyle (at least for me personally hehe) and I will be applying the majority of these habits <3\n\nThank you so much for the best content Sadia! 🤍🌿"", 'You are filled with Possitivity and Beautiful smile ✨✨', 'Thank you❤', 'I like  this video.

Another of my least favorite things is the way that one is often confronted by comparisons: that this person or that is in so much of a worse position than oneself, and to look at how they’re coping.  None of these things are particularly helpful irrespective of the intent of the person with whom one is conversing.  To me each of us is an individual and thus our responses are born out of that individuality and the circumstances and environment in and with which each of us has lived.  The thing to learn, which can be difficult, is to accept, feel comfortable with, and most importantly, love ourselves.  We need to surround ourselves with people - friends and loved ones - who understand this, and listen only to those voices.  Build deep and enduring trust-based relationships with them and allow them to speak into one’s life.  And when they do, listen, absorb, reflect, and respond, bearing the aforementioned relationships in mind.  Ask oneself whether or not what one is listening to is intended for good purposes, to build us up and give us hope, or not.  Listen to the ones you trust and love, ignore the rest.

I did a program about positive intelligence where I learned about my inner judge and inner saboteurs, something that we all have and that influence our behaviors and actions. and the hyper-vigilant saboteur is one of my strongest (the one that creates scenarios in the mind and finding a solution what to do when that happens and worries unnecessarily).\n\nWhat we learned in this program was to recognize when we are in our judge mode and the thoughts are not from our true highest self, but the ugly judge that talks us down. and the next thing was recognizing when we are in our saboteur mode (aka overthinking and worrying about things that aren\'t necessary to worry about in my case). being aware of it makes already a big difference because then you can label it (like thinking ""oh hi hyper-vigilant, there you go again."") and that makes it easier to distance yourself from this downward cycle. \n\nthere are also different kinds of techniques to distract the focus from those thoughts to being aware of the moment, such as intentional and aware breathing, fully focussing on tension of the muscles for a minute and then release, or rubbing two fingertips against each other while focusing on the sensation of that, feeling each of your toes etc.\n\nso maybe it helps to think first if this is likely going to happen or unnecessary worry first and if it\'s the second, become aware as it might be your inner saboteur manipulating you, label it, then try to shift the focus and distance yourself from it by doing some exercises, like breath work, or rubbing two fingers against each other (which is my favorite). \n\nmaybe it helps someone :)', ""For me, I feel stressed or overthinking about something.

Since I am German and speak English, it was easy to understand maybe 85% written and spoken Dutch. But I never came around to speak more than a sentence since I lacked the grammar and felt very insecure. Also the pronunciation of the 'G' is absolute hell. And yes, basically everyone speaks English and I worked at the University which is very international, so there never was a real need to learn it. In hindsight I am sad for the lost opportunity. I moved to France now, only for a year, but I am trying my best to improve my French, which is also necessary because almost nobody speaks English here."", 'I went from pointing to things in stores and restaurants because I didn’t know how to ask for things and making a fool of myself to becoming a certified interpreter and working as a translator.

I grew up in Mexico and my parents decided to move to the US. I remember the first day of 5th grade and not understanding a word anyone was saying. It was so overwhelming—to be completely unable to communicate with anyone. I came home crying and begged my mom to take me back to Guadalajara. \n\nWhat saved me was my love of learning. I started with reading preschool and kindergarten level books and progressed to my grade level and beyond. I read every book I could find. Being in an environment where no one else spoke my language forced me to get fully immersed in the language and the culture. \n\nI think practicing speaking a language is so important when we’re learning because that’s how we begin with our native languages. First we learn to speak and we don’t learn to read or write until we go to school. My parents noticed I was starting to lose my Spanish so they agreed I’d speak only Spanish with my mom and only English with my dad. The weird thing is they kept the habit and years later even though my parents and I are bilingual, my dad rarely speaks Spanish, my mom speaks only Spanish at home and I go back and forth between the two languages when we talk. I know it feels like the language will never click in our brain but with practice, it’s possible.\n\nDedication pays off and congratulations on passing exams. :)', ""you're so honest to upload this clip and I really appreciate that.

Typical arrogant English-speaking person's behavior!!!\nAnd then, I asked myself, if my German has improved in the last couple of years. No. Hell, no!\nMy german comprehension was once sufficient enough to have papers, write the doctoral thesis, and so on. But once, you give up improving your language skill, it quickly becomes worse.

As you might see from my name I am from Québec (Bonjour!) so I might be more sensible to this kind of situation because we see it all the time. We sound nice while replying in English, but we are rolling our eyes in your backs, fellow Anglo-Canadians. ""I don\'t need the language anyway, everybody speaks English so well!"" is not as innocent as it sounds: this means you\'d rather have all the people around you, including your husband, his family and your friends, to adapt to your situation instead of putting the effort to speak their native tongue, in their own country, after years of living there. I know they are good, but that\'s not the point, it\'s using it as an excuse that is not acceptable. But it\'s the human nature to reach for comfort, and after years you got comfortable, and it\'s easy to imagine that in a country where everyone speaks it it\'s easier to just postpone learning it. Go to Spain! :P You\'ll speak Spanish within 4 weeks!\n\nTIP TO PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION: If you have friends that speak both English and their maternal tongue, ask them to speak it, but feel free to respond in English if you are shy. You always understand more than you speak (passive learning), while speaking is active (and scary). After a while, integrate some Dutch or French or Italian words and phrases in your English sentences. You will naturally get more comfortable in the language without feeling you are wasting  your friends\' time and killing the vibe. This is how I learned...English. (Yes we have ESL in Québec, but it\'s not enough, especially for conversational skills.)', 'Sadia! Thank you for posting this! I can totally relate because I’m Mexican living in France.

Remember that you're actually watering the roots, not the soil. A moisture meter is also going to be a lot more accurate than your finger.\n\nI would not recommend cleaning your plants in the bathtub, because there's a real risk you will overwater the soil as well. It's important to have a method as to how much water you give your plants, which should also change depending on the seasons and how warm the weather is. If the weather suddenly changes from being sunny to being cloudy for five days, you might risk drowning the roots, so in-between seasons it's worth checking the weather forecast.\n\nLeaf burns don't happen when water touches the leaves, it happens because the salts in the fertiliser draws the moisture out of the leaves when you overfeed the plant. Salt on top of the soil can also come from lime scale in your tap water, so if you see it often you should consider using a water filter jug before watering.\n\nIf you mix some orchid bark into your soil, it prevents the soil from becoming compact and also helps prevent overwatering.\n\nPlants don't mind the morning sun rays because it's not as harsh, it's the mid day sun you want to avoid. Really, most plants can handle direct sunlight, the problem is that plants we keep at home are grown inside so they aren't accustomed to direct sunlight. But you can change that with a bit of patience."", ""I have a question for anyone who can answer it.

During our trading classes we learn all about the milks, their composition and how organic, homogenized, grass fed plant based all differ. What makes a latte or cappuccino frothier is the air molecules binding to the fat molecules and how you integrate the steam into the milk (this is more technique and tools that anything). Because plant based milks don't have the same fat composition this is why they fall flat or lose their fluff or don't fluff at all. Barista series plant based milks typically have added thickerners for this reason. For at home where we don't have fancy steamers using a full fat coconut milk or oatmilk is what I find ideal. Almond milk is nice but burns easily and can have an over powering flavor profile.  If you don't have those available then adding a 1/4 of a tsp to a plant based milks is also good. I heat the milk and pop it in the blitz for 15-20 secs and there you go, super frothy super delicious. Hope this helps someone. 😊"", 'Beautiful video and amazing recipes!

Is this why many people wind up switching to seitan instead of tofu? We\'ve ordered some \'fermented tofu\' on amazon but it tastes totally like crap. Totally different than regular tofu you buy at the store.  What are your thoughts on this? Are you aware of this \'harmful side effect of non-fermented, soy milk made tofu?

Then stir fry garlic, onion, minced carrots, cubed sweet potatoes, and chopped green beans/string beans, and then the mung bean sprouts or any similar sprouts available to you. And then toss it together with the crunchy tofu cubes. Season with salt and pepper. Then roll into the wrappers, fry. Serve with a dipping sauce of equal parts soy sauce and vinegar, with chopped shallot and minced garlic. Chilli peppers in the dipping sauce is optional.

However, to those with a food addiction which literally compromises their health, the idea of keeping a “forbidden” food in the house could literally be deadly to someone who is a recovering food addict. No one would tell an alcoholic that it’s okay to keep vodka around so you can make “peace” with it. Telling a multiple bypass survivor that it’s okay to keep chips in the house amounts to the same bad advice. Let’s be honest. This advice is really about having the privilege of not suffering life-threatening lifestyle diseases. I guarantee no one at PCRM would say it’s okay to buy, occasionally consume, and keep bacon around just to make peace with it. Even setting aside the horrific suffering experienced by animals in our food system, or the environmental destruction caused from particular aspects of our food system, when it comes to human health and physiology, many foods are objectively bad, addictive, and have no place in our homes or bodies. To say otherwise is ethically, environmentally, medically and psychologically untrue.', ""I love this, I suffered with an eating disorder for more than ten years that started after strict dieting (when I wasn't even overweight to begin with) it gives me a lot of hope to see toxic beauty standards being challenged and intuitive eating being championed.

I don\'t count calories, have any big \'fear foods\' or weigh myself as regularly as I did. So honestly I think the idea of intuitive eating is kind of a mixed bag depending on where you\'re at: if you have a restrictive eating disorder the intuitive thing to do may be to eat less, if you have binging tendencies you may not feel the cue for when you\'re full. Sometimes those types of habits can just become ingrained in your body in such a way. Obviously the majority of people won\'t have a severe eating disorder, but if you do experience that I think it takes some time and concentrated effort fighting against what your body is telling you and resetting your hunger cues so to speak. During my time at an inpatient facility they had us on a very strict diet (""strict diet"" not in terms of restrictive, but we had to eat certain things at certain amounts in order to refeed and restore weight) and for someone whose relationship with food is extremely convoluted I think something like that is necessary at first until you get to a point where you can trust your body\'s cues again, like a factory reset I guess.', 'I have been pushing more and more vegan meals at my house...

And this cycle will happen again and again... Fortunately, It didn\'t last long, I stopped & started eating normally again. I love Intuitive eating. Before, If I had a whole pizza for myself, I HAD to finish it even if I was full. Now, I can say ""I\'m full, I can save this for later"". Because eating with a full stomach is not really satisfying. There is no pleasure anymore. The food taste different when you\'re hungry and when you\'re full, pay attention to this feeling. Sometimes, I can feel that my body craves for real food. Real nutrients. Especially after sport. It\'s really important to tun in, to understand the food that makes you feel good/full of energy. I love pastries and industrial food, I still allow myself some treats. But I can feel that it doesn\'t really feed my body.. It\'s just a tasting pleasure. I remember the day I was outside for hours & hadn\'t had breakfast so I was very hungry. I bought a brownie and surprisingly, I didn\'t enjoy it.

The way you detect sugar is completely recalibrated. For example, bread now tasted sweet and I could taste the natural sugar in milk back when I was drinking it.

That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious\xa0and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents\xa0from sending calamity.\xa03\xa0Now,\xa0Lord, take away my life, for it is better for me to die\xa0than to live.”\n4\xa0But the\xa0Lord\xa0replied, “Is it right for you to be angry?”\n5\xa0Jonah had gone out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city.\xa06\xa0Then the\xa0Lord\xa0God provided a leafy plant\xa0and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the plant.\xa07\xa0But at dawn the next day God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered.\xa08\xa0When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah’s head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die,\xa0and said, “It would be better for me to die than to live.”\n9\xa0But God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?”\n“It is,” he said. “And I’m so angry I wish I were dead.”\n10\xa0But the\xa0Lord\xa0said, “You have been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight.\xa011\xa0And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left—and also many animals?” \n\nBut what's more is the good news of putting Your trust in Jesus Christ, God's son, through whom we come to the Father. And there's also a Holy spirit at work. \nJesus is the saviour of our souls and real life full of even more true 100% love, as well as protection from the Satanic powers through sins.\nThere's a lot more behind.

101,100,7UDx1RF9Oho,"['Why can frozen berries sometimes be more nutritious than fresh berries? Many fresh fruits, like berries, and some vegetables too, are picked before they are ripe. This allows them time to fully ripen during transportation, but it means they had less time to obtain and develop a full range of vitamins, minerals and natural antioxidants with help from the soil. Berries destined to be frozen, on the other hand, are picked at peak ripeness, when they’re most nutritious. Both fresh and frozen berries are wonderfully nutritious, and incredibly antioxidant rich; include these little gems in your meals and snacks whenever possible :)', 'My kids would rather die than be given dates with nut butter for snacks…and they would leave home if I stuffed spinach in soups and sauces…and my son would suffocate me with my pillow if he discovered his peanut butter had a colourful variety of seeds whipped into it….all these ideas are super, and in a heart beat I would luv to chuck out almost everything in my pantry and start afresh with all this wonderful food and have my shelves filled with nuts and seeds galore but my kids would arrange to euthanise me before I’m 60….so it looks like I’m stuck with yucky packets of Doritos and donuts and smiths crisps for snacks….😩', 'Brillant ideas❤', 'Love this video', 'Thank you so much 💓', 'Hey you can also check out Odyana for all organic and natural products', 'HI.

So a diet HIGH in monounsaturated fats was detrimental to heart health.   \n\nSo for healthy people watching your fat intake is a good idea.  \n\nThanks for the information. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/b_o4YBQPKtQ"", 'This was really helpful.

Like you said it's grabbing people's attention, because a plethora of chronic diseases is being reversed left and right for people on this diet, and the main focus for those people is regulating insuline, not fat. In fact the prevailing thought within that shool of eating is that fats help you do this while, in conjunction with leafy greens, keep you nurished as well. It's not the saturated fats they warn about but vegetable oils like conola and transfats, supposedly the saturated fats from grassfed animals are excellent. And then there's the whole misinformation about cholesterol, which they say is your body's way to heal inflammation in the cardiovascular system. Very misunderstood apparently.\n\nSo indeed. Sometimes it's difficult to know who to believe, but the facts that people eating this way get healthier in a matter of months, while vegans report getting infertile, hairloss, gutproblems etc. I'm leaning towards a certain other extreme I guess. \n\nAt least in terms of what to believe, not in what I do. Cutting out pasta, rice, grains, patatoes and added sugars is impractical has made me feel so much better allready.

I used to be in an abusive (verbally, mentally ,and physically) 6 year relationship with a guy that was bipolar so he was in his own hell but he wasn't conscious so he has never done any type of healing for himself. Its been quite a few years but ALL that pain I went through, I buried. For over a year now, I have been working on healing from that trauma and I've actually been doing very well in such a short amount of time. Psilocybin has helped me a great deal too, though. My trauma turned me into someone that is afraid to communicate or even speak my mind when certain situations come up. With my current partner (which is extremely spiritual and empathetic. pretty much who i kept dreaming about), I will clench up and look down like I'm about to be physically hurt. I couldn't even see this early on in the relationship (year and 4 months now) but over time my consciousness grew and grew but he also helps me see.

I really enjoy your channel, though it always make me hungry haha... Keep going!', 'My tip on how to choose healthy food is easy: associate your body\'s digestion process with the food you eat. You consume/eliminate food everyday so eating food that spoils within a few days is best to eat (that means it\'s fresh and free of additives/preservatives). Since the human body is designed to digest food nutrients etc./eliminate ""waste"" within 6-8 hours of consumption of the food, there is no need to eat foods that have a shelf life of more than a few days (aside from basic ""want"" I\'m just focusing on identifying nutritional foods). So, the best way to identify what is healthy is to eat foods that, if kept in the cupboard or fridge, would spoil within a maximum 7 day period. This, of course, does not apply to dried/naturally preserved food products like grains, legumes, etc. but rather those food products like produce, animal products, and breads/pastas.', 'I started by making all my breakfast at home.

Look up ecobricks for your non-recyclable plastics  🙂  instead of going into landfill/the ocean, your plastic waste can be used to help build homes and walls for people who need them.\n\n2. Try to buy solid soap and shampoo bars etc where possible. They usually last longer, weigh less, and take up less room than liquid alternatives, meaning less fossil fuel is needed in transporting them and less emissions are created.\n\n3. Learn what your bank invests in. Many of the biggest banks invest in the oil industry and environmentally damaging practices. Consider eco-friendly banks and building societies such as Triodos or Ecology Building Society who won't use your money to support unethical business.\n\n4. If you are using cotton wool pads, disposable cleaning wipes, or any other form of single-use item (even if it's natural/recyclable), consider getting ones you can wash and re-use instead. Reducing waste is better than recycling it.\n\n5. Try to buy from local suppliers. Not only does this support local business but it means less emissions are used to transport your food. Also consider buying fresh food in season and preserving it (such as by freezing or drying it). During winter months, some foods have to be transported from other parts of the world, which has more of a carbon footprint.\n\n6. There are great charities such as Ecologi who focus on climate solutions. You can offset your entire carbon footprint by giving about £5 a month  🙂\n\n7. Buy second hand. It's cheaper for you, often supports an individual or charity, and no resources are used to make your item because it already existed. It's even better than recycling!\n\nI hope these help. Remember you don't have to be perfect, but every little thing you do will help  😊  Find a balance that works for you and just try your best to do what you can  🌍❤️"", 'Thank You Sadia for these small helpful tips and for being open to everyone about your journey.

B-12 is fairly inexpensive so if you, uh, get the itch to try it (sorry) and you end up being allergic to it you won't have wasted a lot of money.\n\nGood _food_ sources of B-12 for vegans are fortified cereals, nutritional yeast (probably the best source) and fortified non-dairy milks.

Today is my 4th day of veganism, I’m happy and I don’t miss my favourite foods (prosciutto di parma and parmesan).

It\'s just that converting to vegan is something I want to be very careful about since I have stomach issues, and I am also lactose intolerant, so being vegan would cut out things that upset my stomach and still provide nutrients. Although currently I am not to sure what hurts my stomach, (I haven\'t got allergy tested yet.) but I assume it\'s junk food, dairy products, unhealthy foods, unbalanced dieting, etc. Being vegan as I said before still provides me with what my body needs. I also think that if I""m vegan I would pay more attention to what I eat, and take more time to provide the correct nutrients.

Eventually, I was laying in my bed screaming in pain - and I ended up in the emergency room where I was told by the doctor that my body was basically 'giving up' after months of stress. It was my body's way of forcing me to slow down. Stress is a scary thing and I hope you're all taking care of yourselves. \n\n\nNow, I watch your videos daily, I deleted accounts on social media, I always do a bit of yoga and meditate first thing in the morning, I cook and I bake, and I'm trying to practice having a healthy and positive mindset."", 'I love you', 'i am currently on my weight loss journey .your channel helped me greatly .thank you so much .', 'you are awesome maam .best self help channel i came across.love you maam for your great work .love from india 😊', 'Came across your youtube channel while i was searching for some healthy tips and I am hooked now.

Living by bare bones. A way to not only cut many expenses but also to save money which will grow wealth. But is this good for you? As I told my own subscribers, I contend that instead of having an existence of ""minimalism,"" living in a shack and a sleeping bag, you should adopt the mindset instead. In other words, you don\'t have to deprive yourself and suffer to have the minimalist mindset which will give you money to invest. The minimalist mindset person will buy only what he needs. He won\'t go in the winter without a coat but will by the cheapest one that does the job--not the designer label. He won\'t buy a 50K car when he makes 80K a year. He\'ll buy the 15K Honda Civic used one and save money on a lesser car payment, insurance and gas. He doesn\'t go to TGI Friday\'s every week--he goes once a month and grills at home the other three weeks. He brings his coffee from home and doesn\'t spend 4 bucks twice a day at Starbucks down the street from his office. See the point? You don\'t have to live like a monk. The minimalist mindset just cuts down on the unnecessary. If you do this you will find that not only do financial problems disappear but you will grow a ton of assets on the side.

Better stock + more interest = more sales = more rotation of interesting pieces + homes for charity items = less waste and money for charities = better for the planet.

If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there\'s good news. Though we broke God\'s Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: ""God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life"" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9).

Not only I managed to veganize most Italian recipes but I also discovered specialised shops and pizzerias with vegan pizza. The original Italian pizza (not to be confused with the American version of it or the pizza sold in food chains) is made of wheat flour, water, salt and yeast as a base then you can customize the toppings as you wish just tell them no cheese. The original Italian pizza is vegetarian, called margherita in honour of Queen Margherita (Margaret), it was invented in Napoli (Naples) and it contains all the colours of the Italian flag: 🇮🇹 basil, mozzarella and tomatoes. Nowadays, in Italy there are different pizza dough available because of celiac people but also healthier version (whole wheat, rye). The original pizza is very healthy for you unlike the industrialised version, if you ever go to Italy, you must try it!\n😁🌞🤗😀💖"", 'Sadia is living proof of the benefit of a WFPB vegan lifestyle.

It has a profound nourishing property for our bodies that is able to help regenerate and strengthen the tissues of the physiology as well as increase our subtle essence known as ojas. Ojas is responsible for maintaining our immunity, vitality, complexion, luster and strength of our entire body.\n\nIn order for these benefits to be conferred, milk has to be digested properly. By nature, the qualities of milk are heavy, dense, cold and sweet. The heaviness in milk will be increased if it is ingested cold, right out of the refrigerator. Therefore, ayurveda recommends that milk should be boiled, reducing the heavy properties and making it more easily absorbed by our bodies.\xa0\n\n\n\nDont eat milk plus sour fruits\xa0\n\nMilk and fruits\n\nIt s fashionable these days to blend fruits into smoothies, and they make for great Instagram pictures. Most of these fruits have a dairy base like milk or yoghurt. This can spell disaster for your health according to Dr Bhagwati. Fruits like banana, strawberries, pineapple, limes and oranges produce heat on digestion. But milk, on the other hand, has a cooling effect. When these fruits are broken down in the stomach, they become sour. When milk and these fruits are consumed together, their mutually opposing qualities can douse the digestive fire. This, in turn, can cause an imbalance of your gut flora. Ama or toxins are created in your stomach, says the doctor. Mixing milk and fruits together often causes colds, coughs, phlegm and allergies\n\n\n\nHuda Shaikh, Nutritionist and Clinical Dietitian at NutriBond, invokes the science of Ayurveda while talking about this combination. She says, “Ayurveda advises against consuming fruits with dairy as it could diminish digestive fire, alter the intestinal flora, produce toxins and lead to sinus congestion, cold, cough and allergies.\n\n\n80% of protein in milk is casein. When you drink milk with fruits, the big amount of casein will accumulate, precipitate in your body and it’s difficult for you to digest and absorb. It can even lead to indigestion and diarrhea. Therefore, it isn’t suitable to add other fruit juices and drinks that are acidic in milk.\n\nnyone who ingests milk with sour fruits, which most fruits are, will most surely be affected, those with a sensitive constitution first. This combination disturbs the digestion and creates toxins in the entire body, which in their turn lead to other issues. However, the toxin build-up may be slow and gradual, and the effects will probably not be considered as being related to this unhealthy habit, because most people including Western doctors don't know about it.\n\nPeople who are very attentive to the signals of their body will know to stay away from this combination as naturally as any living being who senses what is edible and not edible .\n\n\nSo the people around the world\n\n\n\n\nMilk + Citrus Fruits\n\nThe acidity of the citrus will cause curdling of the milk in the stomach and make it harder to digest.\n\n\nMilk + Fruit Juice\n\nMost juice will cause milk to separate and agglutinate, making it hard to absorb and digest. The pH quality will become more acidic when it is mixed with juice, and 80% of casein in the milk tends to agglutinate, or clump together."", 'Omg, I’ve done pho 🍲 for my family. They were so excited about it, it’s so delicious 😋', ""80% of protein in milk is casein.

The fact is most people who do veganism or vegetarian will feel better in the first couple of years because they have cut out all the processed stuff. But because the vegan diet is devoid in alot of healthy fat soluble vitamins, and these vitamins can be stored up in access which is a good thing. As you do vegan for years, your stores of fat soluble vitamins will slowly be used up and once they're all used up after years of veganism your health will start to massively suffer. Don't make this mistake guys. There are a select few types of ethnic people that can actually benefit from eating vegetables, but most people don't do well with them.

But now, I’m really going to stick with it this time and that is because of you, PUL and 5 other minimalist vloggers here on YouTube. And I know that I will succeed this time because I planned everything from the very start. \n\nMy minimalism journey started with my skin care because I really wanted to only use products that don’t contain harsh chemicals. And I hate travelling with a big bag of toiletries. I wanted to find an all-in-one product that cleans my hair, body, face and private parts. Also an all-in-one product that moisturizes my hair, body, hands, face and private parts. And in the past, I tried that no-poo trend and it was terrible! But now I know the secret! I haven’t shampooed my hair for 3 days now and it just really depends on what you eat. \n\nBefore, if I don’t shampoo, I’ll get dandruff all over my scalp. But now that I’m on this diet (I call it the “Jenny Ong Berdos diet”), I don’t have dry and itchy scalp anymore. That’s why my minimalism journey is way easier this time around. I’m so happy and excited for my newly-launched YouTube channel which I literally just posted my first video into, because I want to share my experience and my journey with everyone. \n\nThank you so much, PUL!

You calling it just 'strange' after you introduced yourself as a registered nutritionist on your public platform is not only inappropriate and unethical but also disappointing. I imagine you are aware that people should never feel guilt for when they eat or the quantity they consumed. And that people don't always and should not always eat planned meals but rather trust their hunger cues. Brushing your teeth is also a disordered behaviour.

The other two times I changed it into a pumkin bread. For this I replaced the 3 mashed bananas with around 200g of pumpkin puree and 100g of applesauce. I also added some liquid (to get a consistendy that resembled the mashed bananas because my pumpkin puree was quite thick in texture) and a little bit more sugar since the pumkin isn`t sweet (around 110g instead of 100g). I personally like the orignial version with bananas a little bit more, my family preferred the pumpkin version.

First of all, I wanted to thank you for making such thoughtful & insightful  videos. Your channel has been invaluable to me on my whole, plant based, vegan dietary journey ('lifestyle' would actually be a more fitting/appropriate word, since I'm planning to eat this way forever).\nYour skincare advice came at a time when I desperately needed it. I was already using coconut oil as a moisturizer for the entire body, but haven't started to use it as an a staple until I watched your video on skincare, followed your tips & noticed a drastic improvement in my complexion. My skin has always been dry & dehydrated until I stopped using soap (fancy cleansers with tons of ingredients, most of which came from the brands sold at Whole Foods). Again, I can't thank you enough!\nAdditionally, I had a question which you might be able to answer.   \nI want to make the parfait recipe you generously shared. However, I do not use oil of any kind in my diet. For example, when I saute veggies (usually garlic, onions, carrots, bell peppers & celery) before putting them into the water w/ legumes & potatoes to make a soup, I use a combination of flax seeds and water. I combine flax seeds & water in a cup & let it chill for 5 mins. After that, I add some straight to the pan (it has a raw egg texture/consistency, so it actually prevents veggies from sticking to the pan), put in my veggies (onions & garlic go first before I add in the rest). Then I lightly splash (not pour) while stirring. My veggies look & taste amazing, & I don't feel the difference in taste (not to mention, it's sooo\u200b easy to clean up: nothing's oily so that's just an xtra perk).\nMy question is would I be able to substitute my homemade flax seed 'oil' instead of olive oil when making homemade muesli?"", 'Love this recipe the only thing is I cannot find Goji berries where I live.

I could be happy & still eat 2 big sandwiches, soup, & a slice of cake in one sitting & could still eat more. I don\'t feel full until my stomach is so bloated I have trouble breathing & feel dizzy. And it\'s not all the time though either. I don\'t just binge on everything in sight whenever. I could eat once a day, but eat an entire thing of spaghetti to myself in one sitting. I can\'t share food either. I am extremely possessive over my food. So if I do share to be polite, I either make more than usual, or I eat more to make up for the food I could have eaten and of which had been shared with someone else. I have people making jokes about how much I eat to others, and that I could out eat a pregnant lady if I wanted. My mom says she\'s concerned for if I ever get pregnant too, because I\'d essentially be eating for 5 ppl at a time. I also get extremely cranky if I don\'t eat or have enough to eat. And ""enough"" meaning a meal that\'s not just for one person. Has to be bigger portion wise. My sister and I were just discussing my issue. I went vegetarian in 2011. Even before that, I ate a lot. I did binge, but it wasn\'t as bad. I was still considered normal. When I went vegetarian, it was for the animals. But also, I figured I could lose weight too. So I ate healthy. I made an Instagram account to keep myself in check. My binge eating was basically non existent at that time. My sis and I looked and I ate small meals, healthy etc. I barely seemed to be addicted to carbs. My food was colorful. And then I went vegan in 2015. That completely ruined my life. Financially, mentally, physically, socially etc. I did it for the animals and became extremely militant. Then my Instagram showed my food become more carb filled, larger portions etc. I always seemed to be hungry. Was eating lots of unhealthy foods, but even when I ate healthy, it was carb filled and less filling still. Imagine not eating for 2 days. That\'s how I feel even after a meal. So I have to fill my gut until it\'s about to explode. It all started when I went vegan. 7 years went by, & only now I just went back to vegetarian. & I\'m so lost. I\'m at the heaviest I\'ve ever been. When I 1st when vegetarian, I was 160lbs. For that 1st year, I lost 30 lbs. Got down to 130!!! I was so happy. Now? I\'m 188lbs. Miserable. Depressed. & lost. I just cant seem to control the hunger I feel. And I don\'t know how to cook vegetarian anymore. Which is why I\'ve been looking at my old Instagram posts. My Dr reluctantly put me on ozempic    in the summer because my mom is on it and asked for a sample for me. And it CURED my binge eating. I went from 177lbs at the time down to 160. Then when I went vegetarian, I gained it all back and more. I stopped taking ozempic because I wanted to try more food. So on my next Dr\'s appointment, he told me I don\'t need ozempic because it\'s not working for me anymore. Meanwhile, I went off ozempic. Then he said I can do it on my own. HOW???? I told him I need it for my binge eating and he told me it\'s all in my head. But the fact is, hours after I had my first dose, the hunger I always felt went away. And so I\'m here looking for help because he refused to give me more ozempic.

Since I've discovered your channel I am watching your videos and I must say I become more and more intersted in eating healthier.

I really don't like the taste of soy milk and I really have a hard time swallowing it. I can't get it down my troat. \n\nMuch kisses"", ""First things first, Sadia, your channel is a gem! Now, I tried this recipe yesterday, it was delicious :D my only problem was that the transparent part of the orange (the coating of the orange chunks) didn't blend well and gave a bit of an annoying texture. Maybe it's my (old) blender's fault - anyway, next time I will juice the orange separately and add it to the smoothie. then it will definitely be pure perfection"", 'This is life-changing!
