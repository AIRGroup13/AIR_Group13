# Advanced Information Retrieval Project Group 13

### Introduction

## Project Git Workflow

### Example
- e.g. Feature "implement NLP" -> create branch with name "NLPfuctions" -> implement the functions -> create a merge request to dev branch
-> let another member take a look at the merge request -> if everything is ok accept -> if the project is finished we merge the dev branch into the main branch and publish the work

### Main Branch
- Main branch is only for release
- Every participant needs to accept the merge request from the dev branch
- Only the dev brach can be merge into the main branch.

### Dev Branch
- Dev branch is used to merge feature branches
- The merge of a feature branch can be done only if another member accepts the merge request

### Feature Branch
- Feature branches are to be created for every new functionality that needs to be implemented
- After finishing the implementation of the feature create a merge request to dev
